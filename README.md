# NLP-pipeline-for-chatbots
NLP pipeline that would power a chatbot for open domain question answering.
The (hypothetical) restaurant chain has a website with their menu, history, location, hours, and other information, and they would like to add the ability for a website visitor to ask a question in a query box, and have our deep learning NLP chatbot find the relevant information and present that back. They think that getting the right information back to the website visitor quickly would help drive in-store visits and improve the general customer experience.
